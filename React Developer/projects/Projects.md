## planning

- AIM: web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?”
- FUnctions:

  - A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”.
  - Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules
  - In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Why this project?

This project will solidify your understanding of React and Redux while giving you a chance to express your creativity. You’ll practice improving the predictability of your application’s state; establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

- Requirement
- prop-types@15.6.2
